/**
 * Explains that the reader is showing a consolidated ("as amended") text
 * because EUR-Lex publishes no structured text of the act as originally
 * adopted — see the fallback in `backend/shared/parsed-law-service.js`.
 *
 * Renders nothing unless that fallback actually fired, so callers can mount it
 * unconditionally. The no-recitals line is not optional copy: consolidated
 * texts carry no recitals at all, and without saying so the empty recital rail
 * reads as a bug rather than as what EUR-Lex published.
 *
 * `source: "fmx-consolidated"` stopped being unambiguous once #149 let a
 * reader *request* the consolidated text via `?version=current` — that path
 * also composes a `fmx-consolidated` payload, but for a reason the reader
 * chose rather than one EUR-Lex forced. `version` is what tells the two
 * apart: this notice only concerns the forced case (no `version` requested),
 * because a requested reading gets `ConsolidationNotice`'s own reverse-state
 * banner instead — showing both would say the same thing twice.
 *
 * `ConsolidationNotice` is the mirror image of this one and suppresses itself
 * for the same unrequested source, since "you are reading this law as
 * adopted" is false here.
